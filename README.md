## PuffinClassifier

### Overview
The PuffinClassifier is a Python-based project that leverages scikit-learn to classify three species of puffins using morphological and possibly behavioral features, excluding the species label itself. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning to develop a robust classifier.

### Highlights

* **Data Analysis**: Executed comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis to understand feature distributions and interdependencies.
* **Visualization**: Employed plots to visualize data trends and classifier outcomes, enhancing interpretability.
* **Model Selection**: Justified the selection of the classifier model based on performance metrics and feature relevance.
